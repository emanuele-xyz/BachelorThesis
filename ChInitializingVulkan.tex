\section{Create Vulkan Instance}

To access any of the functionalities offered by Vulkan we first have to create a Vulkan
instance.
To do this we call vkCreateInstance.

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}{\noindent}
    \lstinputlisting[
        language=C++,
        caption={Create Vulkan instance},
        label={lst::CreateInstance}
        ]{src/ChInitializingVulkan/CreateInstance.cpp}
\end{minipage}

\subsection{VkInstanceCreateInfo}

To call vkCreateInstance we need to pass a pointer to a VkInstanceCreateInfo struct.
This struct collects all the information needed to configure our Vulkan instance.

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}{\noindent}
\lstinputlisting[
    language=C++,
    caption={VkInstanceCreateInfo initialization},
    label={lst::VkInstanceCreateInfo}
    ]{src/ChInitializingVulkan/VkInstanceCreateInfo.cpp}
\end{minipage}

\subsection{VkApplicationInfo}

We can see that the VkInstanceCreateInfo struct is not the only thing we need.
We have to specify a pointer to a VkApplicationInfo struct. Such struct describes
our Vulkan application.

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}{\noindent}
    \lstinputlisting[
        language=C++,
        caption={VkApplicationInfo initialization},
        label={lst::VkApplicationInfo}
        ]{src/ChInitializingVulkan/VkApplicationInfo.cpp}
\end{minipage}

\subsection{Layers}

While we initialize our VkInstanceCreateInfo struct, we can specify the layers
that we want to enable.
The specified layers will be loaded after the Vulkan instance creation.

Layers are optional components that hook into Vulkan.
Layers can intercept, evaluate and modify existing Vulkan functions.
Layers are implemented as libraries and are loaded during instance creation.

If we want to enable error checking, we need to load a layer that
provides such functionality.
This kind of layer is know as validation layer.
There are different validation layers.
Here follows an example. Since validation layers cause overhead, we can
disable them when we build the application in release mode.

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}{\noindent}
    \lstinputlisting[
        language=C++,
        caption={Enabling the Khronos validation layer},
        label={lst::ValidationLayer}
        ]{src/ChInitializingVulkan/ValidationLayer.cpp}
\end{minipage}

\subsubsection{Checking whether our layers are supported}

Before creating our Vulkan instance, we should check if the layers we require are
actually supported.
To do this we use vkEnumerateInstanceLayerProperties.
This function returns all the layers supported by our Vulkan installation.
If all the layers we require are present, then we can proceed to create our
Vulkan instance.

\subsection{Extensions}

While we initialize our VkInstanceCreateInfo struct, we can specify the instance
extensions that we want to enable.
The specified instance extensions will be loaded after the Vulkan instance creation.

Extensions are  additional features that Vulkan implementations may provide.
Extensions add new functions and structs to the API.
Extensions may also change some of the behavior of existing functions.
We can either enable extensions at an instance level or at a device level.

We can use an extension to provide a callback to handle the debug messages
generated by the validation layers.

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}{\noindent}
    \lstinputlisting[
        language=C++,
        caption={Enabling an extention to handle validation layer debug messages},
        label={lst::DebugExtension}
        ]{src/ChInitializingVulkan/DebugExtension.cpp}
\end{minipage}

We specify one callback that handles messages generated by
instance creation and destruction.
We also specify another callback that handles all other API debug messages.

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}{\noindent}
    \lstinputlisting[
        language=C++,
        caption={Setting up debug extension callbacks},
        label={lst::DebugExtensionCallbacks}
        ]{src/ChInitializingVulkan/DebugExtensionCallbacks.cpp}
\end{minipage}

The function that creates the VkDebugUtilsMessengerEXT object comes from the
extension we have enabled.
Because of this, we have to load it manually into our address space using
vkGetInstanceProcAddr.
An elegant way to solve this issue us to create a proxy function that handles
this matter for us.

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}{\noindent}
    \lstinputlisting[
        language=C++,
        caption={Extension function proxy},
        label={lst::ExtensionFunctionProxy}
        ]{src/ChInitializingVulkan/ExtensionFunctionProxy.cpp}
\end{minipage}

\subsubsection{Checking whether our extensions are supported}

Before creating our Vulkan instance, we should check if the instance extensions
we require are actually supported.
To do this we use vkEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties.
This function returns all the instance extensions that are supported by our
Vulkan installation.
If all the instance extensions we require are present, then we can proceed to
create our Vulkan instance.

\subsection{Vulkan Instance Cleanup}

When our application is shutting down, we destroy the debug messenger
and destroy our vulkan instance. DestroyDebugUtilsMessengerEXT is an extension
function proxy.

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}{\noindent}
    \lstinputlisting[
        language=C++,
        caption={Vulkan Instance Cleanup},
        label={lst::InstanceCleanup}
        ]{src/ChInitializingVulkan/InstanceCleanup.cpp}
\end{minipage}

\section{Open A Window}

After creating our Vulkan instance we open a window.
To do this we have two options.
We can use a cross platform library that will do all the heavy lifting
for us, so that we don't have to worry about directly interacting with the OS,
freeing us from the burden of knowing how its windowing API works.
We can also decide to not use a library and opening the window ourselves.
We will do the latter, since it's interesting to know how things work under the surface.

Since I'm on Windows, I'll be dealing with the Win32 API.
We won't go in depth about the specifics of this API since it's beyond our scope.

\subsection{Create Window Handle}

To create a handle to a window we use CreateWindowEx.
We use windowStyle and windowExtendedStyle variables to configure how we want our window.

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}{\noindent}
    \lstinputlisting[
        language=C++,
        caption={Creating a window handle using Win32 API},
        label={lst::CreateWindowEx}
        ]{src/ChInitializingVulkan/CreateWindowEx.cpp}
\end{minipage}

\subsection{Computing Window Dimensions}

Before creating our window, we need to compute its width and height.
This is due to the fact that a window comprises of a client area and a non client area.
We usually want our client area to be of a certain size, but CreateWindowEx takes
the whole window width and the whole window height as arguments.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.30]{images/ChInitializingVulkan/Win32Window.png}
    \caption{Anatomy of a Win32 Window}
    \label{fig::Win32Window}
\end{figure}

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}{\noindent}
    \lstinputlisting[
        language=C++,
        caption={Compute window width and height},
        label={lst::AdjustWindowRectEx}
        ]{src/ChInitializingVulkan/AdjustWindowRectEx.cpp}
\end{minipage}

\subsection{Register Window Class}

Before creating our window, we need to register its window class.
To do this we use RegisterClassEx.
This function takes a pointer to a WNDCLASSEX struct.
This struct is used to configure our window class;

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}{\noindent}
    \lstinputlisting[
        language=C++,
        caption={Register Window Class},
        label={lst::RegisterClassEx}
        ]{src/ChInitializingVulkan/RegisterClassEx.cpp}
\end{minipage}

\subsection{Window Procedure}

While filling in our WNDCLASSEX struct, we also passed a WindowProcedure.
This is a callback function that we have to define.
We use this function to handle the events that our window will receive during
the lifespan of our application.

The Win32 API also provides a default window procedure.
Our custom window procedure will call this default procedure when we don't want
to handle particular events ourselves.

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}{\noindent}
    \lstinputlisting[
        language=C++,
        caption={Window Procedure},
        label={lst::WindowProcedure}
        ]{src/ChInitializingVulkan/WindowProcedure.cpp}
\end{minipage}

\subsection{Window Cleanup}

When our application is shutting down, we destroy our window and unregister
its class.

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}{\noindent}
    \lstinputlisting[
        language=C++,
        caption={Window Cleanup},
        label={lst::WindowCleanup}
        ]{src/ChInitializingVulkan/WindowCleanup.cpp}
\end{minipage}

\section{Create A Presentation Surface}

We must link our newly created window to our Vulkan instance.
To do this we create a presentation (or window) surface.
This operation is platform specific.
Since we are using Windows, to create our presentation surface we need
to use vkCreateWin32SurfaceKHR.

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}{\noindent}
    \lstinputlisting[
        language=C++,
        caption={Create Presentation Surface},
        label={lst::CreatePresentationSurface}
        ]{src/ChInitializingVulkan/CreatePresentationSurface.cpp}
\end{minipage}

\subsection{VkWin32SurfaceCreateInfoKHR}

When we call vkCreateWin32SurfaceKHR, we need to pass a pointer to a
VkWin32SurfaceCreateInfoKHR struct.
Such struct lets us configure our presentation surface creation.

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}{\noindent}
    \lstinputlisting[
        language=C++,
        caption={Filling in a VkWin32SurfaceCreateInfoKHR struct},
        label={lst::VkWin32SurfaceCreateInfoKHR}
        ]{src/ChInitializingVulkan/VkWin32SurfaceCreateInfoKHR.cpp}
\end{minipage}

\subsection{Required Instance Extensions}

Vulkan, being cross platform, cannot interact directly with the OS windowing system.
To do this we use extensions.

The first extension that we enable is the instance level KHR surface extension.
This extension exposes a VkSurfaceKHR object that represents a surface to present
rendered images to.
This surface will be backed by the window we have created.

The second extension we enable is platform specific and is needed
to create our VkSurfaceKHR object.
In our case, since we are using Windows, we enable the instance level KHR win32
surface extension.

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}{\noindent}
    \lstinputlisting[
        language=C++,
        caption={Presentation Surface Extensions},
        label={lst::PresentationSurfaceExtensions}
        ]{src/ChInitializingVulkan/PresentationSurfaceExtensions.cpp}
\end{minipage}

Notice the define preprocessor directive right before including our Vulkan header.
We do this to access our native platform functions.

\subsection{Presentation Surface Cleanup}

When our application is shutting down, we destroy our presentation surface.

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}{\noindent}
    \lstinputlisting[
        language=C++,
        caption={Presentation Surface Cleanup},
        label={lst::PresentationSurfaceCleanup}
        ]{src/ChInitializingVulkan/PresentationSurfaceCleanup.cpp}
\end{minipage}

\section{Pick A Physical Device}

Now that we have a Vulkan instance and a presentation surface, we select
a physical device (a GPU) that supports the features we need.
The selected GPU will be the one that will be used by our application.

\subsection{Listing Available Physical Devices}

We first get a list of all the physical devices that are available on the
system.
To do this we use vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices.
These physical devices can either be integrated or dedicated GPUs.

\subsection{Finding A Suitable Physical Device}

Now that we have a list of all the physical devices, we can select one of them.
We could, for example, automatically pick the first one without doing any kind
checking.
This approach is doable if we don't have any particular requirement for our
physical devices.

Usually we have a set of specific physical device features that are mandatory
for our application to run.
Hence, in our list, some physical devices will be suitable for our application, while
others won't.

The approach we take here is to iterate through the list of all physical devices and
picking the first one that is suitable for our application.
One question still remains: how can we tell if a physical device is suitable or not?

\subsubsection{Spport Grpahics Operations}

To check if our physical device supports graphics operations we list all
the queue families of our physical device.
To do this we use vkGetPhysicalDeviceQueueFamilyProperties.
Then we check if at least one queue family supports graphics operations.

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}{\noindent}
    \lstinputlisting[
        language=C++,
        caption={Check for graphics operations support},
        label={lst::SupportGraphicsOperations}
        ]{src/ChInitializingVulkan/SupportGraphicsOperations.cpp}
\end{minipage}

\subsubsection{Spport Present Operations}

To check if our physical device supports present operations we list all
the queue families of our physical device.
To do this we use vkGetPhysicalDeviceQueueFamilyProperties.
Then we check if at least one queue family supports present operations.

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}{\noindent}
    \lstinputlisting[
        language=C++,
        caption={Check for present operations support},
        label={lst::SupportPresentOperations}
        ]{src/ChInitializingVulkan/SupportPresentOperations.cpp}
\end{minipage}

\subsubsection{Support Presentation To A Surface}

Not only our physical device must support present operations.
It must also be able to present images to the screen.
Image presentation is tied to the window and consequently to the surface
associated with it.
For this reason, image presentation to the screen is not part of Vulkan.
We have to enable the KHR swapchain device extension to support such operation.
We need this extension because image presentation to a surface is achieved using
a swapchain.

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}{\noindent}
    \lstinputlisting[
        language=C++,
        caption={Device extension for image presentation to the screen},
        label={lst::DeviceExtensions}
        ]{src/ChInitializingVulkan/DeviceExtensions.cpp}
\end{minipage}

As we have seen earlier, before enabling an extension, we should check for its
support.
To check whether our physical device supports one or more device extensions we use
vkEnumerateDeviceExtensionProperties.
This function returns a list of all the extensions supported by our physical device.
Then, we simply check whether all the extensions we require are present in the list.

\subsubsection{Support A Present Mode}

Checking if a swapchain is supported is not sufficient.
Even if it's supported, it may not be compatible with our presentation surface.
We need to check whether our physical device supports at least one present mode
for our presentation surface.
We can do this using vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfacePresentModesKHR.
This functions returns a list of present modes supported by our physical device
that are compatible with our presentation surface.
If there is at least one present mode in the list, then we are good to go.
